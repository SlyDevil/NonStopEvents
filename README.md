# NonStopEvents

Reduces the cooldown between crusade event cards to 1 day rather than being a random number between 5 and 7.

The toybox setting for instant events doesn't do anything related to the CrusadeEvent cards despite seemingly being relevant. This is my personal fix to pass through all events within a chapter; at just over 40 events for chapters 3, and me taking between 21 and ~50 days to finish act 3, 1 event a day will pass through all of the event cards in approximately the time needed to finish act 3.

If you find lich to be too long, you can look at my Lich Decree Reduction mod which helps lich start their mythic quest after ~2 weeks rather than 6.
